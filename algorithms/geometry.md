- ==You have a plane with lots of rectangles on it, find out how many of them intersect.== [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-two-rectangles-overlap/)
- Which data structure would you use to query the k-nearest points of a set on a 2D plane? Priority_queue
- ==Given many points, find k points that are closest to the origin.== [link](https://github.com/tongzhang1994/Facebook-Interview-Coding/blob/master/Find%20K%20Closest%20Points.java)
- ==How would you triangulate a polygon==?
